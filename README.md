A Raspberry Pi Pico based Wirelesss Bad USB, that can do attacks on a system by controlling it wirelessly. It can run scripts and payloads, as well as connect the pc to the Pico hotspot and transfer the data to the onboard sd card.
The pico puts out a hotspot that the attacker can connect to and work the magic. The pico has to be connected to a system where it gets its power from the usb connection, while acting as a keyboard to run commands without the user finding it. Can be used for penetration testing and ethical hacking.
The pico is also connected to a sd card, that stores payloads or data that is hacked from the target machine. This device can be disguised as a hard drive or any legitimate device and can be used to attack a system.
Created as a mini project for 3rd year cybersecurity.
